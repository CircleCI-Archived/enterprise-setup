# CircleCI Enterprise Setup

This package allows you to easily orchestrate your CCIE cluster in AWS using Terraform.

# Getting Started

## Pre Reqs

- Terraform

## Installation

### Basic

1. Clone or download this repository
1. Execute `make init` or save a copy of `terraform.tfvars.template` to `terraform.tfvars`
1. Fill in the configuration vars in `terraform.tfvars` for your cluster. see [Configuration](#configuration)
1. Run `terraform init` to install Terraform plugins.
1. Run `terraform apply`
1. Once your installation has finished, you can use [our realitycheck repo](https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck) to check basic CircleCI functionality

### Teardown

1.  
    1. If you set `services_termination_protection_disabled=false` in `terraform.tfvars`, skip this step.
    
    1. Manually disable termination protection in the AWS UI.  To do this, go to the EC2 Management Console, locate the services box instance, select it and click `Actions` -> `Change Termination Protection`.

1.
    1. If you set `force_destroy_s3_bucket=true` in `terraform.tfvars`, skip this step.
    1. In the AWS Management Console, locate the S3 bucket associated with your CircleCI cluster and delete all its contents.

1. Run `terraform destroy` to destroy all EC2 instances, IAM roles, ASGs and Launch configurations created by `terraform apply`.
